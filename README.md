##Things to enhance given more time
1. Using multiple modules for example a separate module for `station`
2. Polish the UI a bit more.
3. Reuse some xml views like loading and error.
4. Maybe using data binding (It's very helpful with working with xml views) however viewbinding is simple and is easier to migrate to jetpack compose.
5. Use navigation library for list details.
